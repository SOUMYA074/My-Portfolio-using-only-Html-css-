# My Portfolio Website

[View Live Demo](https://soumya074.github.io/My-Portfolio-using-only-Html-css-/)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! It’s a blend of simplicity and awesomeness, cooked up with **just HTML and CSS**. Who needs fancy frameworks when you have the basics, right?

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: This baby looks good on everything—desktops, tablets, phones, maybe even your smartwatch (if you squint).
- **Clean Layout**: Like my room (just kidding, this layout is actually clean). It’s all neat and tidy, so you can find stuff without a treasure map.
- **About Me Section**: A little intro about me—just enough to keep it cool, not creepy.
- **Projects Section**: A gallery of my masterpieces (okay, projects). Check them out and be amazed!
- **Contact Section**: Stalk me responsibly. I’ve dropped links to all my social media and email.
- **Technical Quotes Slider**: Because inspiration needs a runway—and I gave it one with a slider. Fancy, huh?

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The skeleton.
- **CSS**: The stylish outfit.

Together, they’re like peanut butter and jelly—a perfect match.
